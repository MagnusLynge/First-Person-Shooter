# First-Person-Shooter
4th Semester Specialization Project

Made by: Magnus Lynge Johansen - student at UCN

This is a first person shooter game, which is the specialization project for the 4th semester at UCN.

The game will focus on having different types of enemies, that behave in different ways, depending on which state they are in.

I will therefore aim to increase my knowlegde and understanding of using state machines
to create and manage different enemy A.I. states in-game.
